>"Don't belive everything you think." &mdash; _Allan Lokos_

I am a scientist-turned-(scientific) programmer. Using my Ph.D. in physics, I have worked in the
areas of computational biology, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and bioinformatics.
I like to teach whenever I get a chance, and I'm told I communicate with a flair for making technical
material understandable without compromising content. In addition, I proudly support the
Oxford comma.

I currently stay home to provide and coordinate care for my son, an awesome and 
spirited 10yo, as well as keep busy with community projects and maintain
my programming chops.

At this point in my life, I'm looking for a job that is flexible yet challenging and meets 
my work/life balance needs more than pay or position.

I currently live in Portland Oregon with my amazing wife Karen, our son Tov, our lovable but no-so-bright
dog Poodle mix Cooper, and whatever pets Tov has at the moment.
