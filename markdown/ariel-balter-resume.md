LEADING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
-----------------------

-   Automated submitting ChIP-Seq analysis code to a computing cluster.
    This saved time and improved consistency of results.
-   Organized and led two successful workshops on bioinformatics
    computing skills. Close to 100 students, postdocs, and faculty
    attended each one. Workshop content published on GitHub.
-   Automated extracting and organizing crops from stained tissue
    images. Increased the investigators' throughput by a factor of 100x
    and was included in a publication.
-   Novel computer model for chick embryo development (43 citations).
-   Novel computer models for atomic-scale reaction-diffusion systems
    (31 citati ons).

ABOUT ME
--------

I'm old(er). Before studying physics, I did lots of different
things—mostly carpentry and woodworking. I play the guitar ok. I’m nice.
