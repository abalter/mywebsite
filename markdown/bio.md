I am a scientist-turned-programmer. Using my Ph.D. in physics, I have worked in 
the areas of computational biology, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and bioinformatics. 
Prior to finishing college and going to graduate school I worked as a carpenter and cabinet maker.

In addition to research and development, I love to teach whenever I get a chance. I'm told I 
have a flair for communicating technical material to diverse audiences without compromising 
content. I proudly support the Oxford comma.

I am currently a stay-at-home parent, keep busy with personal and community projects, and try to maintain my programming chops.

At this point in my life, I'm looking for a job that is flexible yet challenging and meets 
my work/life balance needs more than pay or position.

I currently live in Portland Oregon with my amazing wife Karen, our son Tov, our lovable-but-no-so-bright
Poodle mix Cooper, and whatever pets Tov has at the moment.
