    <h2 id="leading-accomplishments">LEADING ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated submitting ChIP-Seq analysis code to a computing cluster. This saved time and improved consistency of results.</li>
      <li>Organized and led two successful workshops on bioinformatics computing skills. Close to 100 students, postdocs, and faculty 
          attended each one. Workshop content published on GitHub.</li>
      <li>Automated extracting and organizing crops from stained tissue images. Increased the investigators' throughput by a factor of 100x 
          and was included in a publication.</li>
      <li>Novel computer model for chick embryo development (43 citations).</li>
      <li>Novel computer models for atomic-scale reaction-diffusion systems (31 citati ons).</li>
    </ul>
