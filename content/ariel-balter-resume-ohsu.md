LEADING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
-----------------------
-   Automated submitting ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq next-generation sequencing
    analysis code to a computing cluster. This saved time and improved
    consistency of results.
-   Organized and led two successful workshops on bioinformatics
    computing skills. 100+ students, postdocs, and faculty
    attended each one. Workshop content published on GitHub.
-   Implemented original system to extract and organize crops from stained cancer
    tissue images. Increased the investigators' throughput by a factor of
    100x (33 citations).
-   Co-Published novel computer model for chick embryo development (43 citations).
-   Co-Published novel computer models for atomic-scale reaction-diffusion systems
    (31 citations).
-   Organized and maintained software inventory for computational scientists.
-   Improved storage and retrieval of historical video documents at a government
    facility.

ABOUT ME
--------
I'm old(er). Before studying physics, I did lots of different
things—mostly carpentry and woodworking. I play the guitar ok. I’m nice.
