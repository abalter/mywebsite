## **Bioinformatics Scientist**

### Providence | Earl A. Chiles Research Institute      08/2020 \- 06/2022

* Created a reproducible ETL pipeline for generating a drug-repurposing graph database that cleans, harmonizes, and processes over four billion rows of data from 10 different cancer databases, including clinical variants, clinical tumor sequencing data, tumor cell-line drug response data, variant allele frequencies, and gene essentiality.

* Located errors in combined WES tumor variant calls and suggested methods to resolve them.

* Scaled up ETL and analysis pipelines for WES and WGS variant analysis using BigQuery and Google Cloud Platform.

* Helped automate dockerized workflows for RNA-Seq analysis on the Google Cloud Platform.

## **Computational Biologist**

### OHSU | Casey Eye Institute  07/2018 \- 04/2020

* Extracted obscured information from messy human microbiome data by fine-tuning statistical models.

* Created a reproducible notebook-based pipeline for automated statistical analysis with custom parameters on a high-performance computing cluster and produced automated reports.

* Analyzed 16-S rRNA microbiome sequencing data by performing phylogenetic associations, diversity analysis, and multiple statistical tests to identify significant associations with age-related macular degeneration, contributing to two publications.

## **Computational Biologist**

### Oregon Health & Science University, Bioinformatics Core     11/2015 \- 06/2017

* Automated image region selection for an IHC image analysis pipeline, increasing throughput 100x and allowing high-throughput analysis for cancer research.

* Created a templated and automated pipeline to perform parameterized ChIP-Seq analysis on a high-performance computing cluster and generate automated reports.

* Programmed custom LIMS dashboard elements using R and Javascript (Plotly) for real-time visualization of cancer SMMART trials.

* Installed and managed research-oriented Linux servers and performed systems administration.

* Conducted RNA-Seq analysis.

* Mentored and trained coworkers in programming and high-performance computing.

## **IT Support Technician**

### Volpentest HAMMER Federal Training Center   08/2014 \- 11/2015

* Helped develop a ColdFusion website to publish and schedule safety courses to be used on the Hanford site.

* Vetted, selected, and managed a SAAS library management system.

* Built and managed two MS Access databases with entry forms, comprehensive reports, and a macro to email library users about their accounts.
