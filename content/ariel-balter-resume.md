CURRENT POSITION
-----------------
June 2018-present: Computational Biologist in the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health and Science University, Portland OR  

LEADING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
-----------------------
-   Created reproducible pipeline for statistical analysis of clinical 16s human gut microbiome data. Discovered novel
    relationships between AMD, demographics, genotypes, and the microbiome.
-   Automated submitting next-generation sequencing analysis to a computing cluster. This saved time and 
    improved consistency of results.
-   Organized and led two successful workshops on computing skills attended by 100+ students, 
    postdocs, and faculty.
-   Increased image processing pipeline throughput by a factor of 100x (33 citations).
-   Co-Published novel computer model for chick embryo development (43 citations).
-   Co-Published novel computer models for atomic-scale reaction-diffusion systems (31 citations).
-   Improved storage and retrieval of historical video images at a government library.

ABOUT ME
--------
I'm old(er). Before studying physics, I did lots of different
things—mostly carpentry and woodworking. I play the guitar ok. I’m nice.
