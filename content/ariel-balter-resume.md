Goals
-----

_I seek a position where I can contribute to research while advancing in
biomedical computing and analysis through experience and education. My
physics Ph.D. gives me broad quantitative training, deep computational
skills, and incisive scientific intuition. I am currently pursuing a
post-graduate degree in biostatistics at OHSU. In whatever positions I
hold, I actively contribute to the wider community. I also promote
reproducible research with literate programming, notebooks,
self-documenting code, version control, and strict data provenance by
example and through mentoring and teaching._

Leading Accomplishments
-----------------------

  - Created reproducible, templated pipelines for multi-stage
    statistical analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

  - Created and coded real-time dashboard plots for a web-based lab
    notebook for targeted cancer treatment trials.

  - Lead-authored scientific papers on theoretical and computational
    methods in physics, biophysics, computational biology, and physical
    chemistry, and co-authored papers using bioinformatic analysis and
    image processing pipelines.

  - Designed and maintained databases at the Hanford safety library.

  - Collaboratively organized and leading successful workshops on
    computing skills attended by 100+ students, postdocs, and faculty.
    Community STEM outreach.

Personal Notes
--------------

Returned to school at 27yo to complete bachelor’s degree, PhD at 38yo.
Before that, worked in restaurants, freelance writing, and mostly
carpentry/woodworking. Hobbies include cooking, baking artisan bread,
gardening/preserving, building things. I play guitar and mandolin ok.
I’m nice (usually).
