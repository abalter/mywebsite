# Introduction

_Using my quantitative and computational background as a Ph.D. physicist, I successfully transitioned to 
biomedical data science: Bioinformatics and Statistics._

_I want to work on projects where I will increasingly participate in statistical analysis and modeling until 
I become an expert. I hope to continue my graduate education in statistics and ultimately earn a master's degree 
as well as fill the machine learning hole in my skill set._

_Projects and organizations with a public mission especially appeal to me._

# Accomplishments
- Launched a business-academic collaborative research project integrating multiple large-scale public genomic 
  data sets into a graph database suitable for machine learning.
  
- Created reproducible, templated pipelines for multi-stage statistical analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

- Created and coded real-time dashboard plots for a web-based lab notebook for targeted cancer treatment trials.

- Lead author on theoretical and computational methods publications physics, biophysics, computational biology, and 
  physical chemistry, and co-authored papers using bioinformatic analysis and image processing pipelines.

- Designed and maintained databases at the Hanford safety library.

- Promotes reproducible research with literate programming, notebooks, self-documenting code, version control, and strict 
 data provenance by example and through mentoring and teaching.

# Bio
I returned to school at age 28 to complete a bachelor’s degree; Ph.D. at age 37. Before that, I worked in restaurants, freelance writing, and primarily in carpentry/woodworking. Hobbies include cooking, baking artisan bread, gardening/preserving, building things. I play guitar and mandolin ok. I’m nice (usually).
