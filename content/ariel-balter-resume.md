## Goal
_I have levereaged my quantitative and computational background as a Ph.D physicist to 
successfully transition to biomedical data science: Bioinformatics and Statistics._

_I am also working towards a graduate degree in statistics, and plan to increasingly include
statistical analysis in my work and research. I am open to volunteering my data science skills
for non-profit organizations._

_As a data scientist, I promote reproducible research with literate
programming, notebooks, self-documenting code, version control, and
strict data provenance by example and through mentoring and teaching._

## Leading Accomplishments

  - Created reproducible, templated pipelines for multi-stage
    statistical analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

  - Created and coded real-time dashboard plots for a web-based lab
    notebook for targeted cancer treatment trials.

  - Lead author on theoretical and computational methods publications
    physics, biophysics, computational biology, and physical chemistry,
    and co-authored papers using bioinformatic analysis and image
    processing pipelines.

  - Designed and maintained databases at the Hanford safety library.

  - Promotes reproducible research with literate programming, notebooks,
    self-documenting code, version control, and strict data provenance
    by example and through mentoring and teaching.

  - Interfaces with stakeholders to implement technology solutions.

## Bio

Returned to school at age 28 to complete a bachelor’s degree; Ph.D. at
age 37. Before that, worked in restaurants, freelance writing, and mostly
carpentry/woodworking. Hobbies include cooking, baking artisan bread,
gardening/preserving, building things. I play guitar and mandolin ok.
I’m nice (usually).
