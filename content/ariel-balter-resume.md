# Introduction

_I'm a Ph.D. physicist turned biomedical data scientist. I have several exceptional strengths: Keen and discerning scientific mind. Ability to swiftly identify the essence of a task, question, or problem, then assimilate the background and context. Wizardry with data engineering and a tenacious drive for consistency, accuracy, and efficiency. Weaknesses include problems with executive functioning, interpersonal skills, and sometimes simply doing what I have been asked to do._

_My Primary skills include bioinformatics (NGS, genomics, microbiome), statistics (methods, analysis, modeling), mathematical modeling, programming (R, Python, etc.), Data Engineering (cleaning, harmonizing, ETL, ELT, No-ETL), visualization, and technical and non-technical writing._

_I was diagnosed with autism in 2022 and ADHD in 2021, which I treat with medication. This information has helped me understand past challenges at work and school and how I have struggled to succeed professionally and socially. I have an immense amount to offer if I can be accepted, understood, and supported. While I can sometimes be a difficult employee to manage, I 100% commit to my work and bring an uncanny level of creativity and insight._

_Right now, I align with the neurodivergence paradigm. I see my autistic traits and behaviors as integral to who I am physically and cognitively and not things I implicitly need to correct or mask. To help my colleagues feel respected and at ease, I can generally conduct myself in ways that non-autistic people find more acceptable. Sometimes I can't._

_If you are open to hiring someone who can be respectfully insubordinate but is endowed with remarkable ingenuity and perseverance, I believe you will be glad you gave me a chance to work for you._

# Accomplishments
- Launched a corporate-academic collaborative research project integrating multiple large-scale public genomic 
  data sets into a graph database suitable for machine learning.
  
- Created reproducible, templated pipelines for multi-stage statistical analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

- Created and coded real-time dashboard plots for a web-based lab notebook for targeted cancer treatment trials.

- Lead author on theoretical and computational methods publications physics, biophysics, computational biology, and 
  physical chemistry, and co-authored papers using bioinformatic analysis and image processing pipelines.

- Designed and maintained databases at the Hanford safety library.

- Promotes reproducible research with literate programming, notebooks, self-documenting code, version control, and strict 
 data provenance by example and through mentoring and teaching.

# Bio
I returned to school at age 28 to complete a bachelor’s degree; Ph.D. at age 37. Before that, I worked in restaurants, freelance writing, and primarily in carpentry/woodworking. Hobbies include cooking, baking artisan bread, gardening/preserving, building things. I play guitar and mandolin ok. I’m nice (usually).
