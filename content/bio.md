I am a scientist-turned-programmer. Using my Ph.D. in physics, I have worked in 
the areas of computational biology, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and bioinformatics. 
Prior to finishing college and going to graduate school I worked as a carpenter and cabinet maker.

In addition to research and development, I love to teach whenever I get a chance, and I write well. I'm told I 
have a flair for communicating technical material to diverse audiences without compromising 
content. I proudly support the Oxford comma.

I have spent time in the past as a stay-at-home parent and worked part-time. I currently work full-time. I'm slowly progressing towards a M.S. in Statistics or Biostatistics.

I currently live in Portland Oregon with my amazing wife Karen, our son Tov (what planet is he from?), our playful cat Mr. Muffin Maker, and whatever other pets Tov has at the moment.
