I am a scientist-turned-programmer. Using my Ph.D. in physics, I have worked in 
the areas of computational biology, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and bioinformatics. 
Prior to finishing college and going to graduate school I worked as a carpenter and cabinet maker.

In addition to research and development, I love to teach whenever I get a chance, and I write well. I'm told I 
have a flair for communicating technical material to diverse audiences without compromising 
content. I proudly support the Oxford comma.

I have spent time as a stay-at-home parent and now work part time as a computational biologist. At this point in my life, 
I'm focusing on my work/life balance more than pay or position.

I currently live in Portland Oregon with my amazing wife Karen, our son Tov, our playful cat Mr. Muffin Maker, and whatever other pets Tov has at the moment.
