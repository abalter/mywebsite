Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

-   Example of RMarkdown notebook used in my work. Experimenting with usign tabs to
    make the presentation less overwhelming. No fancy graphs, but I love the `DT` package
    download links for tables. Because it is an "html_notebook" it includes the button at
    top right to download the code.
